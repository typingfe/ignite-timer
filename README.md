## Description

The Pomodoro Timer is a web application developed in React using Vite as the build tool. This project aims to help users manage their time effectively through the Pomodoro technique, which divides work time into 60-minute intervals followed by short breaks.

**Technologies Used:**

-   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and lightweight setup for React projects.
-   **LocalStorage:** Used to store session data and keep it persistent across page reloads.
-   **Context API:** Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
-   **React Router:** A library used to create routes and navigation within the application.

**Features:**
